    title: "What Is Interest?",
    date: "2026-02-27",
    standard: `**💰 Day 1: What Is Interest?**

Before we can talk about building wealth, we need to understand one word: **interest**.

🧱 **The Concept**
Interest is the price of borrowing money — or the reward for lending it.

❓ **Why It Matters**
Every dollar you save or invest earns interest. Every dollar you borrow costs interest. Understanding which side you're on is the first step to financial independence.

⚙️ **How It Works**
Imagine your friend borrows $10 from you. They say "thanks, I'll give you $11 back next week." That extra $1? That's interest. You got paid for letting someone else use your money.

Banks work the same way. You put money in a savings account → the bank uses it → they pay you interest as a thank-you.

📖 **Definitions**
• **Interest**: Money paid for the use of money
• **Lender**: The person who gives the money (that's you when you save)
• **Borrower**: The person who uses the money (that's you when you take a loan)

🎯 **Buffett Wisdom**
Warren Buffett bought his first stock at age 11. He understood early: make your money work *for* you, not against you.

❓ **Tomorrow's Question:**
*What happens when you earn interest... on your interest?*`,
    parable: `**🏰 The Parable of the Seed Lender**

In a small village at the edge of a golden valley, there lived a boy named Kael who had nothing but a single sack of seeds — left to him by his grandmother, who whispered on her last day: *"Seeds are not for hoarding, child. They are for growing."*

---

One spring morning, a farmer named Tobren came to Kael's door, hat in hand.

"I have rich soil but no seeds," Tobren said. "Lend me your sack, and after the harvest, I will return it — plus ten extra handfuls, as thanks."

Kael thought carefully. The seeds were all he had. But his grandmother's words echoed in his mind.

He handed over the sack.

---

Summer passed. The rains came and went. And when autumn painted the valley in amber and gold, Tobren returned with a full sack of seeds — and ten extra handfuls, just as promised.

Kael stared at the bounty. "I did nothing," he said. "I just... let you use what I had."

Tobren smiled. "And that is exactly why you were rewarded. You gave your seeds a chance to *work*. Most people bury them in jars under their beds, where they sit and rot. You let them grow."

---

That night, Kael sat by the fire, counting his seeds. He had more than he started with — not because he toiled in the fields, but because he understood a simple truth:

> *When you lend what you have to someone who can grow it, the world pays you back with more.*

The village elders had a word for those extra ten handfuls. They called it **interest** — the reward for trusting your seeds to the soil of another.

---

**🌾 The Moral**

Every coin you save is a seed. You can bury it in a jar, where it sits unchanged. Or you can plant it — in a bank, an investment, a venture — and let it grow.

But beware: the same force works in reverse. When *you* are the borrower, it is *your* harvest that someone else reaps.

The wise ones of the valley always asked themselves: *Am I the lender of seeds — or the one paying for them?*

❓ *Tomorrow's tale: What happens when the seeds from your harvest... grow harvests of their own?*`
