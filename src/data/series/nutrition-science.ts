        sonnet: `**🪶 Sonnet I: The Measure of Fire**

Before the feast, before the bread is blessed,
Before the wine is poured, the table set—
There burns a truth inside each morsel's breast:
A tiny flame the ancients called "the debt."

For every bite you take is borrowed heat,
A spark of sun trapped deep in grain and fruit,
The energy that moves your hands and feet,
That fuels the mind from blossom down to root.

The healer held a seed above the flame—
"This holds the fire of a thousand suns,
And whether feast or famine, all the same,
Your body counts each spark before it runs."

*To eat is not to fill — it is to burn.*
*Know what you feed the fire, and wisdom learn.*`,
        standard: `**🍎 Day 1: What Is a Calorie?**

Before we can understand nutrition, we need to understand one word: **calorie**.

🧱 **The Concept**
A calorie is a unit of energy. It measures how much fuel your body gets from food.

❓ **Why It Matters**
Everything your body does — breathing, thinking, walking, even sleeping — requires energy. Calories are how we measure that energy. Understanding calories is the foundation of every nutrition decision you'll ever make.

⚙️ **How It Works**
Imagine your body is a campfire. Food is the wood. A calorie is how we measure how much heat each piece of wood gives off. A small twig (a celery stick) barely keeps the fire going. A big log (a slice of pizza) burns hot and long.

Your body needs a certain number of calories per day just to survive — this is called your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). For most adults, that's 1,400–2,000 calories just for basic functions. Add movement, exercise, and thinking, and you need more.

If you eat more calories than you burn → your body stores the extra as fat (saving wood for later).
If you eat fewer than you burn → your body uses stored fat for energy (burning the reserves).

📖 **Definitions**
• **Calorie**: A unit of energy from food (technically a kilocalorie, or kcal)
• **BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)**: Calories your body burns at rest just to keep you alive
• **TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)**: BMR + all activity — the total calories you burn in a day
• **Caloric Surplus**: Eating more than your TDEE → weight gain
• **Caloric Deficit**: Eating less than your TDEE → weight loss

🎯 **Science Wisdom**
"A calorie is a calorie" is technically true for energy math — but not all calories affect your body the same way. 100 calories of broccoli and 100 calories of candy have very different effects on hunger, hormones, and health. The number matters, but the *source* matters more.

❓ **Tomorrow's Question:**
*If calories are energy, what are the three types of fuel your body can burn — and why does it matter which one you eat?*`,
        parable: `**🏰 The Parable of the Three Fires**

In a village beyond the mountains, there lived a healer named Maren who kept three fires burning in her kitchen — never more, never less.

---

One winter evening, a young apprentice named Lila arrived at her door, shivering and hungry.

"Please," Lila said. "I've walked three days. I need food."

Maren set a bowl of warm stew before her. But before Lila could eat, the healer held up her hand.

"Tell me first — what is food?"

Lila blinked. "It's... what you eat when you're hungry?"

Maren shook her head. "Food is *fire*. Every bite you take carries a tiny flame inside it. Your body doesn't eat food — it *burns* it."

---

She led Lila to the three hearths.

"Watch." Maren tossed a small twig into the first fire. It flickered briefly and died. "That is a leaf of lettuce. A whisper of flame."

She placed a thick branch in the second fire. It crackled and burned steadily for minutes. "That is a bowl of rice. A slow, steady burn."

Then she dropped a dense, resinous log into the third fire. It roared to life, burning hot and long. "And that is a spoonful of oil. A fire that lasts."

---

"Your body is these three hearths," Maren said. "Every day, they need a certain amount of fuel just to keep burning — to keep your heart beating, your lungs breathing, your mind thinking. This is your *resting fire*."

"What happens if I feed them too much?" Lila asked.

"The extra fuel doesn't vanish. Your body wraps it up and stores it — like stacking wood in the cellar for winter."

"And if I don't feed them enough?"

Maren smiled. "Then your body opens the cellar and burns what's stored."

---

Lila looked at her stew with new eyes. It wasn't just food. It was fuel. Fire. Energy.

"How do I know how much fire I need?" she asked.

"Ah," said Maren. "That is tomorrow's lesson."

---

**🌾 The Moral**

Every bite of food is a tiny flame. Your body is the hearth. Understanding how much fire you need — and how much you're feeding it — is the first step to nourishing yourself wisely.

> *"To eat without knowing is to burn without watching the fire."*

❓ *Tomorrow's tale: What are the three types of fuel — and why does Maren keep three separate hearths?*`
