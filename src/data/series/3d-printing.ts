    standard: `🖨️ Day 1: The Layer Cake Revolution

🧱 The Concept
3D printing builds objects layer by layer from the bottom up — instead of carving material away (subtractive manufacturing), you add material only where it's needed (additive manufacturing).

❓ Why It Matters
Traditional manufacturing requires expensive molds, CNC machines, or skilled hand-crafting. 3D printing lets anyone with a $200 machine turn a digital file into a physical object on their desk. It democratized making things the way the internet democratized information.

⚙️ How It Works
Imagine building a castle out of pancakes. You pour one thin pancake, let it set, then pour another on top, slightly different shape. Layer after layer, you build up a 3D structure from flat 2D slices. That's exactly what a 3D printer does — it reads a digital model, slices it into hundreds of thin layers, then deposits material (usually melted plastic) one layer at a time. The most common type, FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling), works like a computer-controlled hot glue gun moving on rails.

📖 Definitions
• **Additive Manufacturing**: Building by adding material layer by layer (opposite of subtractive, like CNC milling)
• **FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling)**: Most common 3D printing method — melts plastic filament and extrudes it through a nozzle
• **Filament**: The spool of plastic wire fed into an FDM printer (usually 1.75mm thick)
• **Slicer**: Software that converts a 3D model into layer-by-layer instructions the printer can follow

🎯 Maker Wisdom
The best way to learn 3D printing is to print something, watch it fail, and understand why. Every failed print teaches you more than any tutorial.

❓ Tomorrow's Question:
What are the different types of filament materials, and how do you choose the right one for your project?`,
    parable: `# The Workshop of Wonders

Finn had always been the kind of boy who took things apart. Clocks, music boxes, his mother's bread machine — nothing was safe from his curious fingers. But he could never quite put them back together the way he wanted. The pieces never fit his imagination.

One autumn morning, following rumors of a workshop that could build *anything*, Finn found himself standing before a crooked door at the end of Threadneedle Lane. A sign above it read: **ORNA'S FABRICATIONS — If You Can Dream It, It Already Exists.**

He knocked.

The door swung open to reveal a vast workshop unlike anything he'd seen. Shelves lined every wall, filled with impossible objects — a translucent chess set, a working miniature windmill, a pair of shoes with gears in the soles. And in the center stood Orna, a broad-shouldered woman with silver-streaked hair and ink-stained hands, carefully watching a strange machine on her workbench.

"You're staring," Orna said without looking up.

"What *is* that?" Finn whispered.

On the workbench, a mechanical arm moved back and forth with hypnotic precision. Beneath its tip, a tiny golden thread melted and hardened, tracing a shape — layer upon layer — building something from nothing. A tower. No, a lighthouse. It was growing before his eyes.

"Most people think making things means starting with a block and cutting away what you don't need," Orna said, finally turning to face him. "Like a sculptor with marble. But what if you could build from nothing? Add only what matters, exactly where it matters, one thin layer at a time?"

She gestured to the lighthouse, now six inches tall and still growing. "Each layer is just a flat slice. Simple. Ordinary. But stack enough ordinary slices together, and you get something extraordinary."

Finn reached out to touch the base. It was solid. Real. Built from hundreds of layers so thin he couldn't see where one ended and the next began.

"Can it build anything?" he asked.

Orna smiled — the kind of smile that suggested she'd been waiting for exactly that question.

"That," she said, "depends on what you feed it. Come back tomorrow, and I'll show you the threads that make the world."`,
    sonnet: `🪶 Sonnet I: The Maker's First Light

From empty air, a tower starts to rise,
No chisel strikes, no marble block is hewn—
A golden thread beneath the maker's eyes
Lays down its path by afternoon from noon.

Each layer thin as morning's earliest frost,
Each pass precise as starlight finding ground,
What sculptors carved with all that stone they lost,
The maker builds without a wasted round.

A lighthouse grows where nothing stood before,
From flat and simple slices, stacked with care,
The ordinary opens up a door
To shapes that once lived only in the air.

*So dream in layers, patient, thin, and true—*
*The world is built by those who start with few.*`
