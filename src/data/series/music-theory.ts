    sonnet: `**🪶 Sonnet I: The First Vibration**

Before the song, before the chord was struck,
Before the orchestra or hymn began—
A single string was plucked by chance or luck,
And sound became the oldest speech of man.

The air itself was shaken into waves,
Each crest a pitch, each trough a silence born.
The tuner heard what no one else yet saves:
That every sound has color, shape, and form.

"This trembling," said the blind man, pressing near,
"Is not just noise — it has a name, a place.
Between the lowest rumble and the clear
High ring, twelve tones divide the sonic space."

*All music starts with one vibrating thing—*
*A note is just the name we give it when it sings.*`,
    standard: `**🎵 Day 1: What Is a Note? — Sound Has a Name**

Before we can play music, read music, or understand why certain songs make you cry, we need to start at the very beginning: **what is a note?**

🧱 **The Concept**
A note is a single musical sound with a specific pitch. Pitch is determined by how fast the air vibrates — faster vibrations = higher pitch, slower = lower. Western music divides all possible pitches into 12 named notes that repeat in a pattern.

❓ **Why It Matters**
Every melody you've ever loved, every chord that gave you chills, every beat that made you move — all of it is built from notes. They're the atoms of music. Understanding them unlocks everything else.

⚙️ **How It Works**
When you pluck a guitar string, it vibrates back and forth, pushing air molecules in waves. Your ear catches these waves and your brain interprets them as sound. A thick, loose string vibrates slowly — you hear a low, deep note. A thin, tight string vibrates fast — you hear a high, bright note.

Western music names 12 of these pitches: **A, A#/Bb, B, C, C#/Db, D, D#/Eb, E, F, F#/Gb, G, G#/Ab**. After the 12th note, the pattern repeats — the next A sounds like the first A, just higher. This repetition is called an **octave**.

Think of it like a clock with 12 hours. After 12, you're back to 1 — same position, new cycle. Notes work the same way, spiraling upward forever.

📖 **Definitions**
• **Note**: A single sound with a specific pitch and duration
• **Pitch**: How high or low a sound is, determined by its vibration frequency (measured in Hertz)
• **Octave**: The interval between one pitch and the next pitch with double its frequency — same note name, higher register
• **Sharp (#)**: A note raised by one half-step
• **Flat (b)**: A note lowered by one half-step

🎯 **Musical Insight**
The note A above middle C vibrates at exactly 440 Hz — meaning the air pulses 440 times per second. The A one octave higher? Exactly 880 Hz — double the frequency. This mathematical relationship is why octaves sound so "right" together. Music is math you can feel.

❓ **Tomorrow's Question:**
*If there are 12 notes, why do most songs only use 7 of them? What is a "scale" and how does it turn random notes into music?*`,
    parable: `**🏰 The Parable of the First Vibration**

In a city of noise — hammers, carts, shouting vendors — there lived a street musician named Wren who could play any tune by ear. She'd hear a melody once and have it on her fiddle by sundown. But she had a secret: she had no idea what she was actually *doing*.

---

One afternoon, a blind piano tuner named Old Ferro arrived at the square. His fingers moved across a battered upright piano, tightening strings with a wrench no bigger than a spoon. He didn't play — he just listened, turning pegs until each string hummed to his satisfaction.

Wren watched, fascinated. "What are you listening for?"

"Names," Ferro said.

"Names?"

"Every sound has a name. This—" he plucked a string, and a warm, steady tone filled the square— "is A. It vibrates 440 times each second. Not 439. Not 441. Exactly 440."

"How can you possibly know that?"

Ferro smiled. "Because I can hear colors. And A is amber."

---

He plucked the next string. Higher, brighter. "This is also A — but up here." He plucked both together. They rang in perfect agreement, like two voices singing the same word at different heights.

"Same name, different height," Wren said.

"Exactly. The higher A vibrates twice as fast — 880 times per second. Between them?" He played every key from the low A to the high A, one at a time. Twelve distinct sounds. "Twelve steps. Twelve notes. Then the pattern begins again."

Wren counted on her fingers. "It's like... a spiral staircase."

"Now you see it." Ferro closed the piano lid. "Every piece of music ever written — every lullaby, every war march, every love song — is made from these twelve sounds, arranged in time. That's all music is. Named vibrations in a pattern."

---

"But I've been playing for years without knowing any of this," Wren said. "My ear just... finds the right sounds."

"And it serves you well," Ferro nodded. "But imagine how much further you could go if you could *name* what your ear already knows. A painter who can see colors but can't name them — she paints beautifully, but she can't teach, can't communicate, can't understand *why* certain colors work together."

He pressed a single key — middle C — and let it ring.

"This is where everything begins. One vibration. One name. Learn the names, and the music opens up."

---

**🌾 The Moral**

A note is the smallest unit of music — a vibration with a name. There are twelve, and they repeat forever. You don't need to know them to enjoy music, but naming them is the first step to truly understanding it.

> *"The musician who plays by ear hears the river. The musician who knows the notes can see where it flows."*

❓ *Tomorrow's tale: If there are 12 notes, why do most songs only use 7? Ferro shows Wren the secret of the scale — and why some notes belong together.*`
